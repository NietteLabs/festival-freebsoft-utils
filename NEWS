User-visible changes to festival-freebsoft-utils:


* Changes in festival-freebsoft-utils 0.2

** Speech Dispatcher rate and pitch setting changed.

Now the Speech Dispatcher to Festival pitch/rate value mapping is smooth and
pitch is set relatively to the default pitch of current voice.

** The event handling mechanism was reworked.

Event handling was redesigned to produce better results and to be cleaner and
more robust.

** There is new option for disabling initial pauses in synthesized samples.

See the variable inhibit-initial-pauses.

** Utterance chunking implemented in SIOD.

It is now possible to perform utterance chunking not only in tts_file, but in
any extension function.

** Synthesized events can be returned in multiple wave forms.

See the manual entry of the multiple.scm module for description why this can be
useful.  The Speech Dispatcher interface was enhanced this way too.

** New utility functions added.

See documentation of the util.scm and wave.scm files for the complete list of
available utility functions.

** SoX is required.

The SoX sound processing tool is now required for most of the functionality.
