=====================================

The Free(b)soft project is pleased to announce festival-freebsoft-utils 0.1.

* What is festival-freebsoft-utils?

  festival-freebsoft-utils is a collection of Festival utilities that
  enhance Festival with some useful features.  They provide all what is
  needed for interaction with Speech Dispatcher.

  Key festival-freebsoft-utils features are:

  - Generalized concept of input events.  festival-freebsoft-utils
    allows not only plain text synthesis, but also insertion of sounds
    and logical event mapping.

  - Substitution of events for given words.

  - Spell mode.

  - Capital letter signalization.

  - Punctuation modes, for reading or not reading punctuation
    characters.

  - Speech Dispatcher support.

  - Enhancing the Festival extension language with some functions
    commonly used in Lisp.  Also, wrapping existing Festival functions
    by your code is possible.

  - Everything is written in Scheme, no patching of Festival is needed.
