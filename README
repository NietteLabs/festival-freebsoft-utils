This is a set of Festival utilities, focused on Festival cooperation with
Speech Dispatcher.  It provides especially the following features:

- Generalized input object concept.

- Use of sound icons in Festival.

- Punctuation modes.

- Spelling mode.

- Capital letter signalization.

- Speech Dispatcher interface.

It's all in an early stage of development.  Some things could be done in better
or more powerful way, any help is welcome.

You can contact us at the mailing list speechd@freebsoft.org.


REQUIREMENTS

- Festival 1.4.3.


INSTALLATION

- Copy all the *.scm files to a directory contained in the Festival's
  load-path.  (Type `load-path' in Festival to view the directory list.)


CONFIGURATION

The interface can be configured using a number of Festival variables listed
below.  You can get the documentation of a variable by typing

  (doc VARIABLE-NAME)

in Festival.

Available user variables are:

- word-mapping: Allows to map single words or punctuation characters to
  events.

- event-mappings: Maps events of any supported kind (i.e. logical, text, sound,
  character, key) to other events (typically to text or sound events).  All
  logical events used must be defined here, other kinds of events are processed
  in some default way if there are not defined in this variable.  The `capital'
  logical event serves for signalling capital letters in the capital letter
  signallization mode.

- speechd-languages: Defines mapping between ISO language codes and Festival
  language names.  If you need to add support for a new language, you must add
  it here.

- speechd-language-voices: Defines voices available for each of the supported
  languages.
