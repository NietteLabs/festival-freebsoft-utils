This is a set of Festival utilities, focused on Festival cooperation with
Speech Dispatcher.  It provides especially the following features:

- Generalized input object concept.

- Use of sound icons in Festival.

- Generalized concept of language, voice and basic prosody setting.

- Punctuation modes.

- Spelling mode.

- Capital letter signalization.

- Word replacement.

- Partial SSML support.

- Speech Dispatcher interface.

- Festival programming extensions.

It's all in an early stage of development.  Some things could be done in better
or more powerful way, any help is welcome.

You can contact us at the mailing list speechd@freebsoft.org.
